# AirBnB-Los-Angeles

This is an attempt to continue and expand Tuan Chris' [mini project](https://github.com/tuanchris/airbnb_victoria).

A summary of Tuan's project: When travelling to Victoria, he spared some time to analyse the AirBnB public listing data of the city, and answered the following questions:
* What Victoria neighborhood has the most listings?
* What is the most popular neighborhood according to reviews?
* What is the best time of year to visit Victoria?
* What amenities are the most common? Are they differ across neighborhoods?
* Can we predict price of a new listing?

Since Victoria is not on my travel bucket list, and LA is, I will use LA's data for my analysis instead.

My project adds some parameter tuning to increase the model's accuracy, as well as answering some more in-depth questions:
* During which period of the year is the booking price cheapest?
* Can we predict the price of an existing listing in the future? [^1]
