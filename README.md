# AirBnB-Los-Angeles

This is an attempt to continue and expand Tuan Chris' [mini project](https://github.com/tuanchris/airbnb_victoria).

A summary of Tuan's project: When travelling to Victoria, he spared some time to analyse the AirBnB public listing data of the city, and answered the following questions:
1. What Victoria neighborhood has the most listings?
2. What is the most popular neighborhood according to reviews?
3. What is the best time of year to visit Victoria?
4. What amenities are the most common? Are they differ across neighborhoods?
5. Can we predict price of a new listing?

 Since Victoria is not on my travel bucket list, and LA is, I will use LA's data for my analysis instead.

 My project adds some parameter tuning to increase the model's accuracy, as well as answering some more in-depth questions:
6. During which period of the year is the booking price cheapest?
7. Can we predict the price of an existing listing in the future? [^1]
